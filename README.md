Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
This  is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It involves a structured and disciplined approach to creating high-quality software that meets user requirements and is reliable, efficient, and maintainable.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
  a)The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
  - marked a shift in viewing software development as an engineering discipline rather than an ad-hoc coding process.done in a conference .
  -  The conference  emphasized the importance of applying engineering principles to software development, which laid the groundwork for future methodologies and practices.
  -  This led to the establishment of software engineering as a distinct field, emphasizing methodologies, best practices, and the importance of requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance.

   b)The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (oop)(1980s-1990s)
     - it became mainstream with languages like C++, Java, and Python. 
      - OOP introduced concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
      -This shift helped improve software scalability and maintainability, addressing issues faced in procedural programming.

  c)Agile Manifesto (2001)
      - It emphasizes values such as individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change over following a strict plan.
      -  This phase introduced a set of principles for software development that prioritized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative progress. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, replaced rigid waterfall models, emphasizing             iterative development, customer collaboration, and responding to change
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

       1) Planning
 – This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, feasibility, and resource allocation. 
        - It helps in identifying risks and estimating costs and timelines.
        
   ii) Requirement Analysis
 – Gathering and documenting functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders to ensure the software meets business needs.
        
   iii) Design
 – Creating software architecture, database structures, and system models.
               - This phase defines how the software will be structured and how components will interact.
               - delivarables include :Design Document, including High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD).
        
   iv)Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code based on the design documents.
                              - The software is built in modules or features and integrated progressively.
                              - it has the following delivarables :Source code, executable modules, and unit test cases.
        
   v) Testing 
– The software is tested for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. 
               - Testing ensures that the application meets the specified requirements before deployment.
               -   Activities include Creating test cases, executing tests, reporting and fixing defects, and validating that the software meets quality standards.

        
  vi)  Deployment 
– The software is released to users, either as a full launch or a phased rollout. Deployment strategies may include beta testing and gradual implementation.
        
 vii)  Maintenance & Support 
– Continuous monitoring, bug fixes, updates, and improvements are made based on user feedback and system performance.





Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  -The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development while Agile is Iterative and incremental development cycle eg Building a banking system or medical software vs Developing a social media app
  - waterfall methodology is rigid and difficult to accommodate changes while agile is highly flexible and  changes can be made anytime
  - waterfall methodology has these  phases: Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance while  agile follows iterative cycles (sprints) where continuous improvements are made
  - Minimal custome involvement of custome  after requirement gathering in waterfall methodology  while there is continuous collaboration with stakeholders.
  - Testing  is performed only after development is complete in waterfall methodology  while in Agile testing is done throughout the development process



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


  - Software Developer
Role: Responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.
     Write, test, and maintain code for software applications and Identifies  and fix bugs and issues in the software.

  -Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Role: Ensures that the software meets quality standards by testing and identifying defects.
 Also develop test plans and test cases based on software requirements and design specifications.
  Logs and track defects using bug tracking tools.

  -Project Manager (PM)
Role: Oversees the software development process, ensuring projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet business goals.
    :Coordinate and lead the project team, including developers, QA engineers, and other stakeholders.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

  -IDEs  are software tools that provide a complete environment for coding, debugging, testing, and managing software projects. eg android studio 
  - VCS helps teams track changes in code, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous versions if needed. eg git
  - 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  i) Requirements can change frequently, leading to scope creep and project delays. to address this challenge  software developers adopt Agile methodologies to accommodate changes through iterative development and continuous feedback and also      maintain clear communication with stakeholders to manage expectations.
ii)Difficult to identify and fix bugs in large codebases
    -to address this challenge  developers  use debugging tools in IDEs, write unit tests, and follow a structured approach like logging and step-by-step debugging.

  iii) Keeping Up with Technology
  - to address technology changes  developers  allocate time for continuous learning through online courses, workshops, and reading technical blogs. Participate in developer communities to share knowledge and experience

iv)Accumulation of technical debt can make the codebase difficult to maintain and extend.
  -  developers regularly refactor code to improve quality and solve the challage  They also  allocate time for addressing technical debt in each development cycle.

  iv)Integrating different components or third-party services can be complex and error-prone.
-The  use modular design principles and well-defined interfaces. Conduct thorough integration testing to identify and resolve issues early.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

i)Unit Testing
  -Testing individual components or units of code in isolation to ensure they function correctly.it helps catch bugs early in the development process. 

ii) intergration testing 
    -it  focuses on verifying the interactions between different components or modules of the software to ensure they work together correctly.

iii) System testing 
- it evaluates the complete and integrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements

  iv) acceptance testing
  used to  verify whether the software meets user expectations and business needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
